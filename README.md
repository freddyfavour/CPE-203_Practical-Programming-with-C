## CPE 203: Practical Programming with C (Previous Semester)

**Repository Contents:**

This repository contains C programs written to reinforce understanding of C programming concepts. These programs were completed for the C programming course for computer engineers at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology during the Previous Semester. The code includes examples of:

* **3x3 matrix:** Basic matrix operations.
* **Addition:** Simple arithmetic operations.
* **Palindrome checker:** String manipulation and conditional logic.

**Compilation and Execution:**

To compile and run these programs, you will need a C compiler (such as GCC).

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/freddyfavour/CPE-203_Practical-Programming-with-C.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd CPE-203_Practical-Programming-with-C
   ```

3. **Compile the C file:**
   ```bash
   gcc desired_file.c -o desired_program
   ```
   Replace `desired_file.c` with the name of your C file and `desired_program` with the desired executable name.

4. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./desired_program
   ```
